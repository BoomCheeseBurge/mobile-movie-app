Created an AppWrite account using GitHub account.

Created a new project within appwrite called "React_Native_Movie_App" with a fixed region of "Germany" for free tier users.

__________

Created a new React Native project with Expo framework using the following command:

npx create-expo-app@latest ./

The './' is there to install the project in the current directory.

If there is a step asking to install a package with the same name as the command, just proceed.

__________

Go to the Expo documentation from the React Native documentation where it (probably) says 'Continue with Expo'.

For the environment, the device will be 'Android' and using built-in modules with 'Expo Go'.

Install the 'Expo Go' app from the Play Store.

Created an Expo Go account.

__________

Start the development server using the following command:

`npx expo start`

After running that command, there will be a barcode shown in the console output.

Scan it using the Expo Go app on your phone.

Afterwards, there will be bundling progress percentage shown on the mobile app and bundling progress on the IDE editor.

When that is done, the view on the mobile app will be the default RN mobile app welcoming view.

__________

Go to this directory path "app/(tabs)/index.tsx" and open up the file.

Try changing the title and see the hot reloading feature in action.

Project Folder Structure
-------------------------

- tsconfig.json

Contains rules that TypeScript will use to enforce type safety throughout the project.

------

- package.json

Contains the project's scripts, dependencies, and metadata.

------

- app.json

Contains the configuration options for the project and is often called the app config.

The slug value contains a unique identifiable value used by Expo when defining the URL (if the project is to be shown in the web).

The orientation value indicates whether the app should initially open in portrait, or landscape, or default screen orientation mode.

The icon is the full path to the app image to be displayed.

The scheme contains a custom URL to enable deep linking.
It is set to the value "movies" so that later on this can be done "movies://path/".

The userInterfaceStyle determines the dark or light mode.

The newArchEnabled was previously discussed as being the new architecture introduced in React Native.

The android object contains specific features that can be extended specifically on Android devices.

------

- scripts folder

Currently contains only a single file to reset the project to the bare minimum code.

------

- hooks, constants, components, assets folder

Contains boilerplate code of custom hooks, constants, components, and assets.

------

- app folder

Allows to route to different screens or views simialrly to NextJS.

    o (tabs) folder

    Manage the layouts for different pages.

__________

Press 'Ctrl + C' to stop the development server.

To strip the project to its bare minimum code, run the following command:

`npm run reset-project`

When asked this question, just say no:

'Do you want to move existing files to /app-example instead of deleting them? (Y/n):'

Afterwards, run the development server again and press R on the keyboard.
